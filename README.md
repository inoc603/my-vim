# Install

For the full and easy install, first Backup your `.vimrc` file and `.vim`
folder in your home directory. Then run `install.sh` directory to install all
plugins and link `.vimrc` and the project folder to home directory.

If some plugins failed to install, you can always intall them manually.

If you want more control, just copy what you need into your own `.vimrc`.
